# SymCrypt (Go Library)

A lightweight **encryption/decryption library** for Go, designed for large files and streaming use-cases.  
It provides simple wrappers around modern symmetric cryptography primitives (AES-GCM / AES-CTR), with support for chunked processing.

## Features

- ðŸ”’ **AES-256-GCM** (authenticated encryption with integrity check)  
- âš¡ **Streaming mode** â€” handles large files without loading them fully into memory  
- ðŸ§© **Versioned file format** â€” allows future upgrades without breaking old data  
- ðŸ”‘ **Configurable key sizes** (16, 24, 32 bytes â†’ AES-128/192/256)  
- ðŸ“¦ Minimal dependencies â€” only Go standard library + `golang.org/x/crypto`
